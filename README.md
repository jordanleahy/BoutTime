## Project Description
_This section is an excerpt from the Treehouse classroom._

## Instructions
For this project, you’ll be building an actual game, ‘Bout Time, from the ground up.

Specifically, the game involves users taking historical events and seeing if they can put them in the correct chronological order. A single round of play consists of ordering four random events, and there are six rounds in each full game. You will not only write the code to build the user interface, you’ll also decide what kind of events to quiz the user about. We hope you embrace this aspect of the project and pick a topic you’ll enjoy - it’ll help you stay motivated and be more fun to show off when you’re done.

In terms of overall difficulty, this app is roughly the same as the quiz app you worked on in Project 2, but of course this time you’ll be starting from scratch. Don’t let that scare you. You have most, if not all of of the tools you need to get the job done. That said, don’t be surprised if you need to re-watch video or ask the community for help. Also, we aren’t requiring you to add any audio for the project, but if you’d like to, we’ve provided a few sounds for you to use.


## Grading

To get a passing grade you'll need to submit a project that meets the following requirements. If your project receives a "Needs Work" rating on any of these tasks, then you'll need to edit your project and re-submit it until it "Meets" or "Exceeds" each task requirement.
